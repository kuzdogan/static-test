Over the last two years, the global\n          crackdown on privacy, freedom of movement, and the right to transact\n          by governments worldwide put us on the edge of a new dark age of\n          regression.\n        </p>\n\n        <quote>\n          <p>\n            \"Without the freedom to transact, you have no other constitutional\n            rights.\"\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            {\" \"}\n            Punk6529:{\" \"}\n            <a href=\"https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1494444624630403083\">\n              On the freedom to transact\n            </a>\n            .\n          </p>\n        </quote>\n\n        <p>\n          We are seriously concerned about the state of the world, but equally\n          so about the state of the blockchain space. While we are absolutely\n          over the moon for the ever-growing mainstream adoption of\n          cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, certain developments leave\n          a bitter aftertaste, and we fear that the most essential values are\n          about to get lost along the way.

We want to emphasize the original\n          cypherpunk vision and build on it.

Since inflation is again about to eat the world, we'd like\n          to use this as a reminder that the system we live in is not\n          infallible, and it's up to us to progress towards change. The fiat\n          currencies we use every day are hardly backed by anything at this\n          point (money printer goes brrr); we just choose to believe in one\n          thing over another. We can choose to build the (financial) future we\n          want to live in; nothing really hinders us!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In the previous years, ETHBerlin always tried to make a difference by\n          pioneering the use of decentralized technologies and nurturing the\n          ecosystem.
