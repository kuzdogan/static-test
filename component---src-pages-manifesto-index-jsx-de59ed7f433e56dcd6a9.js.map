Over the last two years, the global\n          crackdown on privacy, freedom of movement, and the right to transact\n          by governments worldwide put us on the edge of a new dark age of\n          regression.\n        </p>\n\n        <div>\n          <p>\n            \"Without the freedom to transact, you have no other constitutional\n            rights.\"\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            {\" \"}\n            Punk6529:{\" \"}\n            <a href=\"https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1494444624630403083\">\n              On the freedom to transact\n            </a>\n            .\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <p>\n          We are seriously concerned about the state of the world, but equally\n          so about the state of the blockchain space. While we are absolutely\n          over the moon for the ever-growing mainstream adoption of\n          cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, certain developments leave\n          a bitter aftertaste, and we fear that the most essential values are\n          about to get lost along the way.

We want to emphasize the original\n          cypherpunk vision and build on it. In addition, we aim to teach and\n          educate a new generation of hackers about what you can achieve with\n          cryptography, blockchain, and peer-to-peer network technologies.\n        </p>\n\n        <div>\n          <p>\n            \"We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any.

Which anarchist and privacy-preserving tools can we\n          build that enable independence from governments and mega corps?\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          We will encourage hackathon tracks, workshops, and supporters at\n          ETHBerlin³ to focus on the following key aspects:\n        </p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>Private: there is no need for your name, data, or ID.</li>\n          <li>Usable: it has to be accessible and user-friendly.</li>\n          <li>Direct: it does not ask for permission.</li>\n          <li>\n            Subversive: it transforms established orders and structures of\n            power.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Social: it empowers people and makes a difference in somebody's\n            life.\n          </li>\n          <li>Clandestine: it will not comply.</li>\n          <li>Independent: it will not rely on governments or corporates.</li>\n          <li>Impactful: it intends to make a difference.</li>\n          <li>Secure: it does not put anyone at risk.</li>\n          <li>Libre: it will be free both as in free speech and free beer.</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n          Berlin has a dark history of financial scandals, hyperinflation, and\n          bank runs. Since inflation is again about to eat the world, we'd like\n          to use this as a reminder that the system we live in is not\n          infallible, and it's up to us to progress towards change. The fiat\n          currencies we use every day are hardly backed by anything at this\n          point (money printer goes brrr); we just choose to believe in one\n          thing over another. We can choose to build the (financial) future we\n          want to live in; nothing really hinders us!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In the previous years, ETHBerlin always tried to make a difference by\n          pioneering the use of decentralized technologies and nurturing the\n          ecosystem.
