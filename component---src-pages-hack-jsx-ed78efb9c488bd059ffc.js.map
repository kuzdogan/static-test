By giving attendees\n        the space and time to unleash their entire creativity for 48 hours, we\n        encourage everyone to iterate fast on their ideas without the need to\n        worry about anything. It's both an educational event for people that\n        want to learn more about new technologies and a sprouting place for new\n        projects, collectives, and organizations. We try to bring together\n        people that won't meet elsewhere to work on ideas they don't have time\n        for otherwise. We explicetly not only to invite developers, but every\n        profession that's involved in building incredible projects.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        That said, ETHBerlin³ is not a conference.
