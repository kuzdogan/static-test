The DoD is responsible\n        for initiatives that go beyond organizing hackathons and seek to also\n        support the projects coming from our events and community.

This time,\n        we are pushing even further into becoming a festival for people from all\n        backgrounds, and most importantly, a hub where builders will be able to\n        get their creative juices flowing by discovering various cultural and\n        educational experiences spread across the weekend.\n      </p>{\" \"}\n      <p>\n        We are (in random order): Ksenya, Jacob, Franzi, Eylon, Anna, Kirill,\n        Hany, Wesley, Afri, Helena, Stina, Rose, Alex, Ligi, Nich, Carl, MP,\n        Tim, Caspar, Kaan, Raul.
