We are a diverse community. Leave your egos at\n        the door.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"text-xl font-bold\">Be Open</h2>\n      <p className=\"mt-2\">\n        We welcome one and all. We especially love to adopt newbies in the\n        community. We foster decentralized, open communities, society, and\n        technology, so we should be open to everyone and everything. We all\n        bring different backgrounds and experiences. Great things can happen\n        when we show up with an open mind and curiosities to explore. If you\n        don’t have an open mind, this group is not for you.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"text-xl font-bold\">Be Respectful</h2>\n      <p className=\"mt-2\">\n        Be exceptionally kind to others. Respect their work, time, and\n        perspectives. Do not insult or troll others, unless it is for banter\n        (covered in a later point). We all spend our time, resources, and energy\n        to be part of this group. Respect each other, the projects, and the\n        process.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"text-xl font-bold\">Be Daring</h2>{\" \"}\n      <p className=\"mt-2\">\n        Dare to create something nobody did before. If you get stuck, ask for\n        help - people will help you when you ask. This is a community. We create\n        things together.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"text-xl font-bold\">What We Create</h2>\n      <p className=\"mt-2\">\n        Promote Decentralization. Build what matters to you. You can organize\n        events, build applications, or foster public discourse. You can create\n        art and beauty on a computer. Most importantly, create, hack, and build\n        together.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"text-xl font-bold\">Contributions in Other Ways</h2>\n      <p className=\"mt-2\">Banter and memeing is encouraged as you see fit.</p>\n      <h2 className=\"text-xl font-bold\">Personal Responsibility</h2>\n      <p className=\"mt-2\">\n        Everyone in this community is responsible for their own tasks. If you\n        have a project, it is your responsibility to manage it. We are not here\n        to spoon feed you or do your work for you. Ain’t nobody got time for\n        that. But we are a community and here to support.

If you have\n        disagreements with someone, communicate directly with each other and\n        work on a solution.\n      </p>\n      <p className=\"mt-2\">\n        Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments\n        related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability;\n        inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation\n        slides); inappropriate depictions of violence (including presentation\n        slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing\n        photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events;\n        inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcomed sexual attention.\n      </p>\n      <h2 className=\"text-xl font-bold\">Notify Us</h2>\n      <p className=\"mt-2\">\n        If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any\n        other concerns, you can always notify a project lead, event organizer,\n        or member of the core group.
